midget Blender to glge exporter
-------------------------------
	
	The midget GLGE Exporter can create glge scene files out of your blender scene.
	
	This exporter is running with Blender 2.4x.
	For now it's working quiet rudimentarily.
	
	Installation
	------------
		
		Copy to \blender folder\.blender\scripts
		
	Use
	------------
	
		1. GLGE does only support faces with three edges. Use Ctrl + T to convert your meshes' faces to triangles.
		2. save: save your blender file (otherwise recently changes will not effect your exported data)
		3. export: File -> Export -> GLGE Exporter
